                <p>
                    A digital game license key is a unique code that you can use to download and play a game. 
                    When you purchase a game from Attract Game, we provide you with a license key that you 
                    can redeem on the game's platform to download and play the game.

                    The process for redeeming a game license key varies depending on the game's platform. Generally,

                    and enter your game license key there.
